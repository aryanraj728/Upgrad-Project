    <p id="editP">
        James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 â€“ September 18, 1970) was an
        American
        musician, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded
        as one
        of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated
        musicians of
        the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the
        history
        of rock music".[1]

        Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army,
        but was
        discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began
        playing gigs
        on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with
        whom he
        continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England
        in late
        1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK
        top ten
        hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in
        the US
        after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album,
        Electric
        Ladyland, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his
        first
        and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer,[2] he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969
        and the
        Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on
        September 18,
        1970.
        Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high
        volume and
        gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier
        feedback. He was
        also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such
        as fuzz
        distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in
        recordings.
        Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic
        sound
        source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and
        others
        into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3]

        Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of
        Melody Maker
        voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, Billboard named him the Artist of the Year and Rolling Stone
        declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and
        in 1970,
        Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock
        and Roll
        Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums,
        Are You
        Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they
        ranked
        Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.
